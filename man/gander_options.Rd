\title{Options used by the gander package}
\description{
The gander package makes use of a few notable user-facing options.
}
\section{Choosing models}{


gander uses the \code{.gander_chat} option to configure which model powers the
addin. \code{.gander_chat} is an ellmer Chat object.
For example, to use OpenAI's GPT-4o-mini, you might write

\if{html}{\out{<div class="sourceCode">}}\preformatted{options(.gander_chat = ellmer::chat_claude())
}\if{html}{\out{</div>}}

Paste that code in your \code{.Rprofile} via \code{usethis::edit_r_profile()} to
always use the same model every time you start an R session.

The gander package used to use options \code{.gander_fn} and \code{.gander_args},
but those are deprecated in favor of \code{.gander_chat}.
}

\section{Style/taste}{


By default, gander responses use the following style
conventions: "Use tidyverse style and, when relevant, tidyverse packages. For example, when asked to plot something, use ggplot2, or when asked to transform data, using dplyr and/or tidyr unless explicitly instructed otherwise. " Set the \code{.gander_style} option to
some other string to tailor responses to your own taste, e.g.:

\if{html}{\out{<div class="sourceCode r">}}\preformatted{options(.gander_style = "Use base R.")
}\if{html}{\out{</div>}}

Paste that code in your
\code{.Rprofile} via \code{usethis::edit_r_profile()} to always use the same style (or
even always begin with some base set of knowledge about frameworks you
work with often) every time you start an R session.
}

\section{Data context}{


By default, gander will show the first 5 rows and 100 columns of every
relevant data frame, allowing for models to pick up on the names, types, and
distributions of the variables it may work with while also keeping the number
of tokens submitted per chat to a minimum. The option \code{.gander_dims} allows
you to adjust how many rows and columns to supply to gander addin.
\itemize{
\item For richer context but increasing token usage, increase the number of rows
and columns. For example, to supply the first 50 rows and all columns of
datasets supplied to the model, you could use
\code{options(.gander_dims = c(50, Inf))}.
\item To decrease token usage, decrease the number of rows and columns, e.g.
\code{options(.gander_dims = c(0, 10))} to just show the names and types of the
first 10 columns. One could make the argument that setting the number of rows
to 0 is privacy-preserving, but do note that the model may pick up on the
values of specific cells based on code context alone.
}

Set that option in your \verb{~/.Rprofile} to always use that setting.
