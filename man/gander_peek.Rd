\title{Interface with the previous gander}
\usage{
gander_peek()
}
\value{
The ellmer \code{Chat} object from the last assistant interaction,
or \code{NULL} if no previous interaction exists.
}
\description{
\code{gander_peek()} returns the ellmer \code{Chat} object from the most recent call
to the gander assistant so that you can see what happened under-the-hood.

Note that gander initializes a new chat every time you invoke the addin,
so the token count and conversation history only describes the most recent
interaction with the package.

\examples{
\dontrun{
# First, run the addin to generate a response.
gander_addin()

# Then, use this function to examine what happened under-the-hood:
gander_peek()
}
